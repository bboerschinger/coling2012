I went to
pain d'avignon
pain d'avignon yesterday
play
wash first
brioche bread and some
yeah we need to figure out what to do because I'd really like to
nothing we're gonna do today
require
I know but
it was yesterday
probably was pretty vigorous
Naima
you want some water
yes but I'm gonna have some of each kind
if you want one of these
yes
so
what I was thinking was maybe there's some window place
that could be called today
to fix it I mean they're not gonna fix it I don't think
if they were are you allright
what happened
you have a raisin on your face
do you like that
I mean is it something we could even conceive of fixing
raisin
you want some more rice_a
I don't think so
then
we should look in the phone book and see
did they take this out yesterday
yeah yeah they did
I mean I saw them taking it off
yeah
they just probably didn't have a clear sense of what they were doing
I mean they aren't professional window cleaners they're professional
I know
had to be done I would've done the same but I think that at some level they
well I haven't seen what the issue is so
I'm feeding her right now
I know
but more to the point
what I mean is they can't fix it right
no
no they can't fix it I wouldn't want them to try
right
that's what I was saying
