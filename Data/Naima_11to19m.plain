I went to
pain d'avignon
pain d'avignon yesterday
play
wash first
brioche bread and some
yeah we need to figure out what to do because I'd really like to
nothing we're gonna do today
require
I know but
it was yesterday
probably was pretty vigorous
Naima
you want some water
yes but I'm gonna have some of each kind
if you want one of these
yes
so
what I was thinking was maybe there's some window place
that could be called today
to fix it I mean they're not gonna fix it I don't think
if they were are you allright
what happened
you have a raisin on your face
do you like that
I mean is it something we could even conceive of fixing
raisin
you want some more rice_a
I don't think so
then
we should look in the phone book and see
did they take this out yesterday
yeah yeah they did
I mean I saw them taking it off
yeah
they just probably didn't have a clear sense of what they were doing
I mean they aren't professional window cleaners they're professional
I know
had to be done I would've done the same but I think that at some level they
well I haven't seen what the issue is so
I'm feeding her right now
I know
but more to the point
what I mean is they can't fix it right
no
no they can't fix it I wouldn't want them to try
right
that's what I was saying

I hear car

I heard her car come in
she's a little early actually
here's more creamcheese
that's
the knife fell in my lap
hello
hi
hi good
nice and summery dressed for the weather
really I haven't been
out except to get the paper at sixthirty
no
yes
this morning she started saying
yeah right what are you talking about
she's having creamcheese for the first time
right
yeah but you're kind of finished I think
I think you're finished
how was your weekend
that's exciting
Mommy's microphone
play
okay ooh clunk
ooh clunk
okay
there you are
there you are
okay
it's today is June twenty June twentyfifth
everybody's on
that's making a good noise
and I'm gonna test the microphone by clicking the
cd player controls
could hear those very well if this is working
Naima
see how do I test hers
do you wanna put on the cd player
can you put it on
no
okay
let's see we gotta give her
play baby
Mommy will play with you I just wanna get you some crunchy food
can you come here for a second
that's a bowl
would you like a crunchy piece of wheat
no
shoulda heard that pretty loud if hers is working
okay
boy that's stale
okay
I am testing fone
if it's working
you should be able to hear this very clearly
that was the cd player controls
okay I'm gonna shut fone off
no I'm not I'm gonna leave it on
turn on ftwo
this is a test of the transmitter that I believe was not working
I'm close
I can't play right now because I'm figuring out this equipment
you've got a nice cup though
so I'm
bledder bledder is right
so I've got it on fone
I'll try it on ftwo later
on the receiver of fone and ftwo are on
but there is no
I do not have the transmitter for ftwo on
and I'm close to the camera now so I'm gonna walk outside and if you can hear me then
this transmitter is working
because I'm gonna be talking constantly and now I'm in the breezeway and now we're looking outside
right here
well and you definitely would not hear me without the microphone here
so this transmitter itself is not the problem
if this sound is working
okay now we're gonna go back
and replay that
okay the only difference with this test is that
on the receiver from the last session you just heard was that on the receiver
the f two switch is on off
rather than on on
and the other transmitter is still also off so
you shouldn't be able to hear me
if I
if you can hear me now then then what then it makes no difference whether the other transmitter is turned off on the receiver
look there's
hi
hi
you gonna open the door for her
good job
how are you today
okay thanks
okay this is a test of
the transmitter which is on fone right now
and you definitely should not be able to hear this if there's a problem
now this should be fine because I just tested it
this is the one that I thought was not working because it had a new battery
but I did just change the battery so it has a second new battery which may have been the problem
and if you can hear this it's definitely fine
okay now I'm coming back to the camera
I was in the other room
and now I put on the one that's on ftwo
and walk into the other room
what is
and jiggling the camera seems to be there
if I jiggle the camera a little
the green lights are on
okay
the green lights are now on the receiver
they were kind of jiggling
off and on to red
which is bizarre in and of itself
it may be a separate problem
and now with this transmitter on ftwo
I'm going to walk away
and if you can't hear this
at the same volume right now then
receiver is not functioning properly
right
okay stop
okay a double test of the hypothesis that the ftwo channel on the receiver is the malfunction
I've just switched transmitters
the one I have I'm putting onto ftwo
both green lights on the receiver are on
they're on green
and I'm walking into the other room speaking at the same tone of voice
and you shouldn't be able you should be able to
sounds like I'm getting louder and louder now then the hypothesis is correct
okay
let's find your backpack
where is the backpack Naima

plants yeah to water the plants with
that's right let's go through this way
here's the garden I wonder if there's any garlic to pick here
garlic might be ready to take out of the ground
this is the sprinkler
all these flowers need so much water
there's not enough water
won't you be my okay so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this
all the way over here
maybe we'll sprinkle water on this part of the lawn first this is the hose
the hose
I hear some birds do you hear them

hog that's usually where we see the groundhog
over there

today is Monday September twentythird and
we're in the new house and we're playing legos and we just finished having a big snack and playing with crayons

let us play with the legos right up here
so just as a little preface this is a very this is very much a transition time for Naima since we've only slept in our new house three nights so far
although all our stuff has been here longer than that
and this week we have noticed that Naima
goldenrod
what did we do with the goldenrod
we were digging it
we've noticed Naima using adverbs of time alot more and accurately some of the time like nursie now she says
or she says it's raining today
and she likes to say a while ago and she likes to say
I think she says yesterday and she has said tomorrow
what's up
raining tomorrow
it's raining today actually
and she's using personal pronoun you and me
mostly you to refer to herself much more frequently
Mommy carry you she'll say that
and it's also a transition time cause we're doing lots_of new things and meeting lots_of new people just in the last couple weeks
because it's the fall and we started new activities like music class and new music class with new kids in it
we've only been to that twice
and we're at a different group in the library with the big kids
and Naima started a swim class with Daddy and there's new kids in that and it's a new thing to do something with Daddy alone like that
and Naima has a potty now which is right here
which is a very
which is basically a toy right now
so all those things are going on
and there's alot more sentences and long sentences
things off
you mean the legos
let us play with them up here
