Gaspard swallowed his keychain

Gaspard
and his teacher
our teacher was worried
hello teacher
what happened Gaspard she asked
but I didn't answer
I was afraid to tell her about my keychain
no
no
so she called an ambulance and they took Gaspard to the hospital
I had a big room all to myself
the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me
don't worry she said
we'll take good care of you
it won't hurt
but I was still a little scared especially when she took me to the xray room
I think that's when they saw what I swallowed
the doctor said they'd have_to operate
you won't feel a thing they said
you'll be asleep
but I'm not sleepy at all I said
I fell asleep after counting to three and dreamt I was a racecar driver
they were right
I didn't feel a thing
my parents were right there and my mother gave me a great big package
inside was a racecar so big I'd never be able to swallow it
