Gaspard swallowed his keychain

Gaspard
and his teacher
our teacher was worried
hello teacher
what happened Gaspard she asked
but I didn't answer
I was afraid to tell her about my keychain
no
no
so she called an ambulance and they took Gaspard to the hospital
I had a big room all to myself
the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me
don't worry she said
we'll take good care of you
it won't hurt
but I was still a little scared especially when she took me to the xray room
I think that's when they saw what I swallowed
the doctor said they'd have_to operate
you won't feel a thing they said
you'll be asleep
but I'm not sleepy at all I said
I fell asleep after counting to three and dreamt I was a racecar driver
they were right
I didn't feel a thing
my parents were right there and my mother gave me a great big package
inside was a racecar so big I'd never be able to swallow it

and that's a tomato
yeah
do you like tomatoes
yummy
I will never ever not eat a tomato
I have this little sister Lola
she is small and very funny
sometimes I have_to keep an eye on her and sometimes I have_to give her dinner
this is difficult because Lola is a very fussy eater
Lola won't eat carrots of course
she says carrots are for rabbits
I say what about peas
Lola says peas are too small and too green
one day I played a good trick on her
yeah
Lola was sitting at the table waiting for her dinner
those are oranges
and I said
and she said I do not eat peas or carrots or potatoes
or mushrooms or spaghetti
or eggs or sausages
I do not eat cauliflower cabbage or baked beans
or bananas or oranges
and I'm not fond of apples rice cheese or fish sticks
and I absolutely will never not ever eat tomatoes
my sister hates tomatoes
and I said this is lucky because we are not going to be having any of those things
we are not going to eat any peas or carrots or potatoes or mushrooms or spaghetti eggs or sausages
that's Charlie
there will be no cauliflower cabbage baked beans bananas or oranges
and we don't have any apples rice cheese or fish sticks
and certainly no tomatoes
Lola looked at the table
then why are these carrots there Charlie
I don't ever eat carrots
and I said you think they're carrots but they're not these are orange twiglets from Jupiter
what's that
does that look like the moon to you
yeah that's Saturn
that's a planet
they look just like carrots to me said Lola
that's a star
like I wonder if they're confused
because it's not a star shape
you know
there's Lola and she's sitting with a green alien
from Jupiter
I think
yeah
and there's Charlie he's in a spaceship
how can they be carrots I said
carrots don't grow in Jupiter
that's true said Lola
I might just try one
if they came all the way from Jupiter
not bad she said
and took another bite
then Lola saw some peas I don't eat peas said Lola
I said these are not peas of course they're not these are green drops from Greenland
they're made out of green and they fall from the sky
but I don't eat green things Lola said
goody then I'll have your share green drops are so incredibly rare
that's Charlie
maybe I'll just nibble on one or two she said
quite tasty
next Lola saw the potato
next Lola saw the potato I will not eat potatoes so don't even try not even mashed
that's a big potato
this isn't mashed potato people often think it is but it's cloud fluff
cloud fluff from the pointest peak on Mount Fugi
she said in that case a large helping for me please I love to eat cloud
that's a mountain
Mount Fugi
the Fugi mountain
that's one tall mountain
and those are all the clouds
remember
do we see the clouds from the airplane
yeah
Charlie these look like fish sticks to me
really
yeah
were we skipping the fish sticks
and then she said there's Lola Charlie will you pass me one of those
and I said what
one of those
and Lola said yes Charlie one of those
and I couldn't believe my eyes because she was pointing at the tomatoes
that's Charlie
that's Charlie's chin
where's your chin
there it is
and I said are you sure really one of these
and she said of course
moon squirters are my favorite
what's that
a moon
you didn't think they were tomatoes did you Charlie
there's Charlie
there's Lola
Lola
I see you have purple paint on your fingers honey
does that mean it's not on the wall
ocean nibbles
those are really fish sticks
which you won't eat either
green drops
did I tell you when we were flying back from London to Boston the children's meal we ordered
it was fish and chips which like she wouldn't touch
and then like a huge container of chocolate pudding with a candy bar to crumble in it
and like a whole cadbury candy bar
is that your toe
and a bag of smarties which are like m and m's
like are they trying to get her to run up and down the aisles
I know
yeah she didn't eat it
fortunately we didn't offer her any
my gosh
I mean she had a fairly steady diet of lollipops
but at least that takes like half and hour to eat
as opposed to like
I think you have_to turn it on first honey
you wanna press the buttons
you can press this button to
this is a fit waiting to happen
she's trying to get that cash draw open
she's definitely entered the cranky stage because
if she finds a toy that frustrates her she picks and and throws it
she's actually got all her teeth
she got them all really early
she hasn't gotten a tooth in gosh I think she got all her teeth my the time she was a year old
except for her two year molars
I can't tell whether I've been sticking my fingers in her mouth
it's hard to get back so far to see if they're coming in
they're not suppose to come for I guess until she's about two but she got her teeth so early that I'd be surprised if she didn't get these early to
she got her first two bottom teeth in when she was just three and a half months old
it was so bizzare
who's that
is that a little bird
can the bird fly
