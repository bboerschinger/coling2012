one winter morning Peter woke up and looked out the window
snow had fallen during the night
it covered everything as far as he could see
after breakfast he put on his snowsuit and ran outside
the snow was piled up very high along the street to make a path for walking
crunch crunch crunch
his feet sank into the snow
he walked with his toes pointing out like this
that's right
he walked with his toes pointing in like that
he dragged his feet slowly to make tracks
and he found something sticking out of the snow that made a new track
what was it Ethan
it was a
stick
a stick that was just right for smacking a snowcovered tree
then what happened Ethan
down fell the snow
plop
on top of Peter's head
he thought it would be fun to join the big boys in their snowball fight but he knew he wasn't old enough
not yet
so he made a smiling
what's that
snowman and he made
what are those
angels right
he pretended he was a
a messmaker
no a mountain climber
he climbed up a great big heaping mountain of snow and slid
all the way down
he picked up a handful of snow and another and still another
he packed it round and firm and put the snowball in his pocket for tomorrow
then he went into his warm house
he told his mommy all about his adventures while she took off his wet socks
and he thought and thought and thought about it
what's he doing
before he got into bed he looked in his pocket
his pocket was empty
the snowball wasn't there
he felt very sad
while he slept he dreamt that the snow had melted all
sun had melted all the snow away
but when he woke up his dream was gone
the snow was still falling everywhere
new snow was falling
after breakfast he called to his friend from across the hall and they went out together into the deep deep snow

they say there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
what nonsense said Bear
the sky is on fire and all you can do is talk about gold
and he picked up an empty honeypot and ran outside

like we saw today yesterday
but Bear wasn't listening
he was busy climbing a hill
when he got_to the top he threw water at the rainbow
there he goes he's throwing water at it
just then the rainbow faded away
it's going going going gone
Little Bird chirped
look Bear I found the gold
Bear went to the tree
inside he found lots_of golden honey
he filled his pot
and took it home
that night Little Bird came over
Bear made honeycakes
after dinner they went for a boat ride
for a long while they were very quiet

Corduroy Corduroy Corduroy Corduroy
he lost his button
he dropped it on the floor
yeah probably
wanna sit on my lap
that's right he climbed on the mattress
and what did he find on the mattress
do you remember
he found a button
and he pulled it off
there he is there's a picture of him
right
what's he doing
he lost his button yeah
Corduroy is a bear
who once lived in the toy department of a big store
day after day he waited with all the other animals and dolls for somebody to come along and take him home
what's there there's a giraffe and a doll
bunnyrabbit and a
what's that
yeah it's a clown
the store was always full of shoppers buying all sort of things
but noone ever seemed to want a small bear in green overalls
then one morning a little girl stopped and looked straight into Corduroy's bright eyes
mommy she said look
there's the very bear I've always wanted
not today dear her mother sighed
I've spent too much already
besides he doesn't look new
he's lost the button to his overalls
Corduroy watched them sadly as they walked away
I didn't know I'd lost a button he said to himself
tonight I'll go and see if I can find it
what did he do
late that evening when all the shoppers had gone and the doors were shut and locked Corduroy climbed carefully down from his shelf and began searching everywhere on the floor for his lost button
what's that Ethan
an escalator
suddenly he felt the floor moving under him
quite by accident he had stepped on an escalator and up he went
could this be a mountain he wondered
I think I've always wanted to climb a mountain
is it a mountain Ethan
no what is it
yeah it's the escalator
he stepped off the escalator as it reached the next floor
and there before his eyes was a most amazing sight
tables and chairs and lamps and sofas
and rows and rows of
beds
this must be a palace Corduroy gasped
I guess I've always wanted to live in a palace
he wandered around admiring the furniture
Bob wants to read the story
this must be a bed he said
I've always wanted to sleep in a bed
and up he crawled onto the large thick mattress
all at once he saw something small and round
what did he think it was
what did he think it was
why there's my button he cried and he tried to pick it up
but like all the other buttons
on the mattress it was tied down tight
and then what happened Ethan
he yanked and pulled with both paws until
pop
off came the button and off the mattress Corduroy toppled
into a lamp
over it fell with a crash
yes there's Corduroy
Corduroy didn't know it but there was someone else awake in the store
the night watchman was going on his rounds on the floor above
when he heard the crash he came dashing down the escalator
now who in the world did that he said
somebody must be hiding around here
he flashed his light around sofas and beds until he came to the biggest bed of all
and there he saw two fuzzy brown ears sticking out from under the cover
who was it
who's that hiding
Corduroy
hello he said
how did you get upstairs
and the watchman tucked Corduroy under his arm and carried him down the escalator
and put him on a shelf in the toy department with all the other animals and dolls
what are they doing Ethan
they're sleeping that's right
Corduroy was just waking up when the first customers came into the store in the morning
there looking at him with a wide warm smile was the same girl
he'd seen only the day before
I'm Lisa she said and you're going to be my very own bear
last night I counted
I counted what I saved in my piggybank
do you have a piggybank too
yes it's upstairs
that's right
and it has lots_of money in it
and my mother said I could bring you home
shall I put him in a box for you the saleslady asked
no thank you
no thank you said Lisa
and she carried Corduroy home in her arms
she ran all the way up four flights of stairs into her family's apartment and straight into her own room
Corduroy blinked
there was a chair
an a dresser
and next to a girlsized bed
what was next to a girlsized bed
yes that's right a little bed just for him
yes for me
this must be home he said
I know I've always wanted a home
Lisa sat down with Corduroy on her lap and began to sew a button on his overalls
I like you the way you are she said
but you'll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened
you must be a friend said Corduroy
I've always wanted a friend
me too said Lisa and gave him a big
hug
