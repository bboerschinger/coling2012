let's put all the pieces right side up so you can tell
now what goes where here

looks like we need more of the name
yes
animal friends
I think
see we need the rest of the words
the rest of the words are not here

she will certainly be surprised when she sees her new car won't she
this is the car store over here
on the way home pa stopped at a drug store when he came out he got into a jeep
by mistake see the jeep it's a green jeep
you should be wearing your glasses pa pig
Harry and Sally thought that pa had swapped cars with a soldier
then he went to the supermarket
when he came out he got into a police car
you made a good swap Daddy said Harry but pa wasn't listening and he didn't seemed to be thinking very well either don't you agree
look at that police fox
he is blowing a whistle and he's saying stop
stop
that's the pig family in a police car
driving a police car
who's in back of them that's a good question
the police fox is chasing them that's right
and then what happens
next he drove to a fruit stand to buy some apples
when he left he took farmer fox's tractor
my but pa is absent minded isn't he
there's the tractor
it's red
ma will certainly like her new tractor said Sally to Harry
they stopped to watch a fire
when the fire was up they left in the fire engine
how can anyone make so many mistakes
and now what's happening
then they
look at all that dirt
then they stopped to watch some workers who digging a big hole in the ground
no pa did not get into that dump truck by but by mistake he got into he drove the car into the hole
brother
Roger Rhino
no he went into Roger Rhino's power shovel
Ma_Pig was certainly surprised to see her new car
there's Roger Rhino
I am reading the book
here comes Roger now he has found Ma pig's new car and he's bringing it to her
it looks as though he is very angry that means mad
with that someone who took his power shovel
does he look mad to you
I think he is mad
they are feeling a little bit worried I think
Roger please be careful you're squeezing ma's little car just a little bit too tightly
well let's all hope that pa pig will never again make that many mistakes in one day
he's mad
he's bringing the pig's car back to them because he wants to get his steam shovel
pa pig took the steam shovel by accident
it's over here
she is very surprised and looks like Loly Worm's right here in the maw of the steam shovel
is that funny
that pig is worrying because the boat that he's in is about to sink
she's very surprised
the steam shovel is almost knocking her over
by accident
those are the pig children they are watching their daddy drive the steam shovel
let's see what else's in the here
these are different stories
I wanna look for a different story
here's a Loly Worm story okay let's go back and stick this one
the story is called the talking bread
Humper Dink the baker was mixing bread dough with the help of able baker Charlie Mouse
this little girl Flossy watch them squish and squash the dough
they are making dough for bread
you've seen me do that haven't you
yes I use a rolling pin when I make bread
that's the dough that's a lot of dough look at all the
they are kneading the dough
they patted it into loaves of all different shapes and sizes
balls yes bowls are like balls
then Humper Dink
that pig's name is Humper Dink put the uncooked loaves of bread in the hot oven to bake
that's the oven
they're putting the bread dough into the oven to bake it
okay what happens over here
after the loaves
look at all that bread on the wagon
there must be twenty loaves of bread there
after the loaves had finished baking Humper Dink set them out on the table to cool
here you're right on Mommy's microphone I didn't realize that
fresh bread smells good
Mama Humper Dink says Mama
let me just adjust this okay okay
Mama
that's what he says he's surprised
Mama
finally he took out the last loaf
listen did you hear that one when he pick that loaf it said it said Mama
huh but everybody knows that bread can't talk
the bread is talking Naima
it must be haunted
huh help police Humper Dink picked up Flossy and ran from the room
I must telephone sargent Murphy he said
the bread said Mama
sergeant Murphy
that's the police dog
arrived in a hurry
he is driving the motorcycle without his shoes on and his shoes are tied to the end of the motorcycle
because he was in such a hurry
he reached down and picked up the loaf of haunted bread
Mama
ohmygoodness the bread is saying Mama
the bread is talking
Murphy was so startled he fell into the mixing trough
that's where the dough is
he fell into the dough
look at what a mess he is huh
at just that moment Huckle and Loly came into the bakery
who's gonna get him out is right I don't know who's gonna get him out
somebody had better get him out he is going to be all sticky and messy and gooey
that is a very strange loaf of bread
said Loly
yes
stretching out
here's Loly he's slowly ooched across the floor toward it
he's ooching across the floor
that means he's
that's how Loly
that's how Loly walks
he took a nibble the bread said nothing he nibbled and nibbled until only his foot showing
he went into the bread
and still the bread said nothing
Mama
ohmygoodness
Loly stood up
that's Loly and the bread is on top of him
the bread said Mama
Loly took another nibble then stuck out his head I have solved the mystery
he's ooching across the floor up there
I have solved the mystery he said
he is sticking his head out of the loaf of bread
he's
break the loaf open
yeah that's him
but please don't break me
Humper Dink gently broke open the bread and inside was huh Flossy's doll
Mama
baby she says
it had fallen into the mixing trough and had been baked inside the bread
he is opening the bread and finding a doll inside the bread
with mystery solved they all sat down to eat the haunted bread all of them that is except Loly
he had already eaten his fill
he is ooching towards the loaf
ooching
you like that word ooching I like it too
ooching Loly is ooching
that means he is going toward the bread
ooching
ooching
what is Loly doing in that picture Naima
ooching

okay
he is taking a nibble

this is where he dresses up like an alligator
and he scares those mice
that's he's pretending to be a monster like a crocodile
he's wearing a crocodile costume
uncle Willy is wearing it right there
and there's Lolly worm
I think Lolly is saying hello to uncle Willy in that picture
I think that's what's happening
is that sergeant Murphy
sergeant Murphy is taking the pirates away the pirates
pirates
there's the costume nobody's wearing it right now
he made that costume out of some grass grass
he made some cloth out of grass so it was green and made him look like an alligator
that story is in there we can get that story
that's the second story in this book
this says Richard Scary's funniest story book ever
that's the Mr rabbit's story
sergeant Murphy and the banana thief
sergeant Murphy was busy doing what
yes
and then what happened
who came running out of the market
banana's gorilla came running out of the market
he had stolen a bunch of bananas
that's right that means he took them away without asking
without paying for them
yes he's trying to escape them that means run away
Murphy look he's stealing your motorcycle too
banana's gorilla
sergeant Murphy was furious Huckel and Lolly were watching
you're putting the beeper in your shirt
okay you can keep it there while we are reading the story
Huckel and Lolly worm were watching Huckel said you may borrow my tricycle to chase after him if you want to
the beeper is in your shirt
is it tickly
breet that's sergeant Murphy's whistle
and then oops there it goes there it goes the next
maybe it's time to stop this tape
we can still read it there's the milk truck
they raced through a crowded streets don't you ever ride your tricycle in the street
they cross the draw bridge just gentle with that please just as it was opening to let a boat to go through what's that pig doing
swimming
banana stops suddenly and let
gosh he's knocking over the table all the bananas peels are falling in the air and falling on the ground
and the motorcycle knocked over the fire hydrant
what a mess
and who's chasing bananas
and who else
right sergeant Murphy and Lolly worm and Huckle the cat they all chasing him
so he went into the restaurant and then Murphy said to Louie who was the owner
yeah he owns the restaurant that means he brings people the food
his restaurant he owns it
I'm looking for a thief which is Murphy said together the searched the whole restaurant but they couldn't find bananas anywhere
Louie then said seat down and relax
I think there are banana peels in here I think that must mean banana's gorilla is here somewhere
somebody has better to pick up those banana peels before someone slips on one don't you think so
the door is closed but the vacuum cleaner is very loud right now
Louie brought them a bowl of banana soup
where's the bowl of banana soup
and who's sharing the soup

where's bananas gorilla
he's eating it he likes to eat it
I think may be we'll turn off the the camera

there once lived a wolf
who loved to eat
more than anything else
more than anything else in the world
you're right
you know this story
as soon as he finished one meal he began to think of the next
that wolf sure likes to eat
what do you think he's going to do next

and he's going to figure out how he's going to eat her
there's some hummus
yes
one day the wolf got a terrible craving for
chicken pie
yes chicken stew you're right it's chicken stew
all day long he walked across the forest in search of a delicious chicken
finally he spotted one
that means he saw her
she is just perfect for my stew he thought
the wolf crept closer but just as he was about to grab his prey
he had another idea
if there was just if there were just some way to fatten this bird a little more he thought
there would be all the more stew for me
so
the wolf ran home to his kitchen and began to
cook
look at all those things he has in his chicken
what does he have there Naima
what does he have in his chicken
I mean
what does he have in his kitchen there
he has a rolling pin
