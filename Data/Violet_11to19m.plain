yeah but don't they use your license for id usually
I mean it would just be easier if you had your license and you need it
since you've been driving a year without it now
why
why can't you get it
you probably just have_to pay
they're not going to make you take the test
no
they don't do that
it's very rare that I think they make you take the test
unless is your license expired
well you better get a hold of your self
alright and I have these receipts here from radio shack or wherever
well they've been sitting in the bill draw
I know
I know

I called her and left her a message yesterday but I left her a message like last week but I assume that she probably been
away you know or went away and didn't call me before she went away
